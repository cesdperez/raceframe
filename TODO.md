Working on UX improvements on this branch.

- New map styles.
- Changing the structure of the right menu. 
- Preset designs but you can customize

Outstanding issues:
- Maybe better thumbnails or previous for the presets and the dropdown images
- When "customize" is expanded, the preview changes size. But only happens with 1 layout and 1 aspect ratio.
- The cusrtomize section UI looks off.
